Vara is a javascript library that can create text drawing animations

#### [Website](http://vara.akzhy.com) | [Examples](http://vara.akzhy.com/examples) | [Codepen 1](https://codepen.io/akzhy/pen/YdbYbj) | [Codepen 2](https://codepen.io/akzhy/pen/OrdYGO)

## Installation and Basic usage

**Using NPM**

```
npm install vara --save
```

Or download and include the library as follows

```html
<script src="./src/vara.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<!-- Or jsdelivr -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vara@1.2.0/src/vara.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

```javascript
new Vara(
  '#element',
  'font.json',
  [
    {
      text: 'Handwritten',
    },
  ],
  {
    fontSize: 46,
  }
);
```

The first argument, #element is the container element for the SVG.

The font used is a specially created JSON file that contains the information needed to create the text. It is included by passing the URL of the font as the second argument.
A few custom fonts are available in the Github repository, more will be added soon. Creation of custom fonts are explained [here](http://vara.akzhy.com/creating-fonts).

The third argument is an array of objects, where each object will represent a block of text to be drawn. The text to be drawn is passed as the text property.

The last argument is an object to provide the options like fontSize,color etc.

## Options

```javascript
new Vara(
  '#container',
  'font.json',
  [
    {
      text: 'Hello World', // String, text to be shown
      fontSize: 24, // Number, size of the text
      strokeWidth: 0.5, // Width / Thickness of the stroke
      color: 'black', // Color of the text
      id: '', // String or integer, for if animations are called manually or when using the get() method. Default is the index of the object.
      duration: 2000, // Number, Duration of the animation in milliseconds
      textAlign: 'left', // String, text align, accepted values are left,center,right
      x: 0, // Number, x coordinate of the text
      y: 0, // Number, y coordinate of the text
      fromCurrentPosition: {
        // Whether the x or y coordinate should be from its calculated position, ie the position if x or y coordinates were not applied
        x: true, // Boolean
        y: true, // Boolean
      },
      autoAnimation: true, // Boolean, Whether to animate the text automatically
      queued: true, // Boolean, Whether the animation should be in a queue
      delay: 0, // Delay before the animation starts in milliseconds
      /* Letter spacing can be a number or an object, if number, the spacing will be applied to every character.
    If object, each letter can be assigned a different spacing as follows,
    letterSpacing: {
        a: 4,
        j: -6,
        global: -1
    }
    The global property is used to set spacing of all other characters
    */
      letterSpacing: 0,
    },
  ],
  {
    // The options given below will be applicable to every text created,
    // however they will not override the options set above.
    // They will work as secondary options.
    fontSize: 24, // Number, size of the text
    strokeWidth: 0.5, // Width / Thickness of the stroke
    color: 'black', // Color of the text
    duration: 2000, // Number, Duration of the animation in milliseconds
    textAlign: 'left', // String, text align, accepted values are left,center,right
    autoAnimation: true, // Boolean, Whether to animate the text automatically
    queued: true, // Boolean, Whether the animation should be in a queue
    letterSpacing: 0,
  }
);
```

## Methods

#### `.ready(function)`

Is used to execute a function when the font is loaded and the elements are created.

**Any other method should be called inside this function.**

---

#### `.get(id)`

Returns an object with properties `characters` and `container`.

`characters` is an array of svg `g` elements, each representing a letter and container is an svg `g` wrapping the text block.
If an id was given to the text during creation, it should be given as the argument, otherwise use the index of the text block.

---

#### `.draw(id)`

Used to animate texts with `autoAnimation:false`.

If an `id` was given to the text during creation it should be given as the argument, otherwise use the index of the text block.

---

#### `.animationEnd(function(i,o){})`

Used to execute a function once animation ends, triggers every time a block of text is drawn.
Has two arguments,

`i` - The id of the drawn text.

`o` - The object described in the `get()` method.

---

#### `.playAll()`

_Introduced in v1.1.0_

Is used to play the animation of every text block, obeying `delay` and `queue`
